# imageclassificationDeeplearning4j
Image recognition using Deep Belief Networks for Hard Task Classification. Deeplearning4j library was used. 

This Deeb belief network is done using Deeplearning4j ( Deep learning for java library ). 
This network was done to image recogntion. Image classification was used and deep belief network is the 
best solution for hard task classification. In this network there are two labels. 
Image folder paths should be
              
                |--- Folder  ( Type A Images)
Folder ---------|
		|--- Folder  ( Type B Images)
			
Network should be 'tuned' accodingly changing the configuartions is the main class. 
This can be taken as a deep belief network image recognition example using deeplearning4j
